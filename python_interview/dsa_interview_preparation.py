1. what is Queue data structure?
    -Queue aik linear data structure
     hai jo FIFO (First In First Out)
     principle par kaam karti hai. Is
     mein elements ko ek end se add 
     kiya jata hai (enqueue) aur doosre
     end se remove kiya jata hai (dequeue).  
    
    use cases:
    -Task scheduling
    -Print spooling
    -Handling requests in web servers
    -Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs
2. different types of Queue:
    -Simple Queue
    -Circular Queue
    -Priority Queue
    -Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
